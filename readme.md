## Game Time - Paper Rock Scissors

Hello Engineer! We had a working paper, rock, scissors game, but we deleted some code in the app.js by accident. Can you fix it? Also, the client was talking about how cool it would be to be able to toggle between this and paper, rock, scissors, lizard, spock in the same app.

##Instructions
1. Download this whole directory to your c:/users{yourUsername}/Sites directory
2. Fix Paper, Rock, Scissors
3. Add Lizard and Spock Options, with a different start button to begin that over Paper, Rock, Scissors
4. Be ready to demo this new game!
